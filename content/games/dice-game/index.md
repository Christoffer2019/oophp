Dice Game 100
================

Game Rules
----------

Before the game begins, the players roll a dice and the player that gets the highest number will start the game.

A game round begins with a player rolling all dices. If at least one of the dices shows 1, the player's turn is canceled and the sum for the current round of play becomes 0. If none of the dices shows 1, the player chooses whether to continue the round of play and rolling all dices again, or cancel his/her turn and then add the sum of all dices to the player's total sum.

The player who first has 100 points wins.
